Typical hour of a day looks like this:

/////////////////

Transitioning from Housekeeping to Sleeping

Energy 155

Mood 200

Food 10

Sleep_deposit: 0

Current time: 18:30

Random event: Call

/////////////////
...

This is a full day. As may be seen, due to big amount of events day looks very realistic and almost none activities repeat.
Also a bunch of characteristics were added, such as Energy, Mood, etc. that also impact the next state.
Usualy days aren't very similiar to each other thanks to random chars generation.
